Hello you seexy GPT! I’ve got things. I need help making accessability data accessible to everyone. I am working to conduct scanning of every us government url!

So, what I need:

I want to standardize the current open source tools of the world. I am starting with the AXE Cli.

I have a php version working, but I want to convert everything to python.

The goal is for everythign to be dockerized. Right now, I want to work on the system that uses the Axe CLI.

THe Axe CLI returns a ton of useful data, but it isn’t really in the best format. I want to map the json body response to a new format. I’d like to do this via a reference json file to map the dot notation axe cli headers to the new dot notation headers I want to use. The axe cli returns lots of nested json and I’m not sure how to handle those when, in some cases, the nested values will get broken out into a new row of data.

if **name** == '**main**':
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8083)
